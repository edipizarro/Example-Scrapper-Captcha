# Packages
- Puppeteer: ``` npm i puppeteer ```

# Usage
Run on NodeJS (Tested on version 10):
``` node solution.js ```

# What does this script do
Tries to bypass reCaptcha and scrap data from an URL.
It does not work when the script is executed too many times (need to randomize userAgent and ViewPort data)
