# Packages
- Puppeteer: ``` npm i puppeteer ```

# Usage
Run on NodeJS (Tested on version 10):
``` node scrapper-solution.js ```

# What does this script do
Tries to bypass reCaptcha and scrap data from an URL.
It does not work when the script is executed too many times (I think that if userAgent and ViewPort data are randomly generated it may work better)
